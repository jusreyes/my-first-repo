EXPERIENCE
----------

**Student of Computer Science and Economics:** 2017 - present

_Technologies: Java, Python, C, SQL, Octave, STATA_

* Acquire and apply knowledge of current and emerging programming practices, including fundamental engineering and economics concepts, client/server environments, and application development methodologies. Utilize several languages and modern technologies through collaboration with team members on various projects.

**UCSC Economics Department Peer Advisor** Fall 2020

* As a peer advisor for the Economics Department, I answered any questions about the Economics undergraduate program, helped students form and arrange their class schedules and check their graduate requirements.
* Worked on a newsletter group project that was published by the UCSC Economics Department.

**Software Developer (Internship)** Summer 2018
_Technologies: Java

Partnered with a team of programmers to produce innovative software applications while receiving guidance on modern software practices. Performed comprehensive research on algorithms that could potentially be integrated and discover strategies for implementation into hardware.

*Facilitated in the development of a cargo truck temperature tracking application; supplied insights on algorithms that could identify and prevent instances of truck drivers becoming drowsy.

RELEVANT COURSES
--------------------

**Machine Learning**
_Standford University - Online_ Summer 2020
:   Learned and applied most relevant Machine learning concepts such as Supervised and Unsupervised Learning and Statistical Pattern recognition

    * Used Octave to code algorithms such as support vector machines, neural networks, and recommender systems

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
